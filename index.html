			<h1>Black Sash puts Data on a Poster</h1>
			<p><a href="http://www.blacksash.org.za/">Black Sash</a> has embarked on a programme of monitoring and evaluation of various governmental services, including the South African Social Security Agency's (SASSA) payment offices, clinics, and local government. Such a broad programme generates a great deal of data, and when Black Sash attended a data journalism workshop held by Code4SA and School of Data in 2014, attention turned to how to analyse and present the collected data.</p>

			<p>School of Data breaks data projects into four phases: <a href="#collection">collection</a>, <a href="#cleaning">cleaning</a>, <a href="#analysis">analysis</a> and <a href="#presentation">presentation</a>.</p>

				<h2>Black Sash brings high-tech data analysis to fight social problems</h2>
				<p><strong>Press Release</strong></p>
				<p>Civic society organisation Black Sash is using data to ensure that South African citizens get the services to which they are entitled.</p>
				<p>Black Sash has evolved from a women’s anti-apartheid struggle organisation, into a modern data-driven non-profit. It assist the most vulnerable in our society by measuring and monitoring government services, like grant payments, clinics and local government, through its Community Based Monitoring Programme. </p>
				<p>After gathering a huge amount of data from the community and government departments, Black Sash took data that would usually be trapped on a computer or web page, and created posters that communities and government officials could gather around and initiate a dialogue.</p>
				<p>“Black Sash worked with 20 community partners monitoring 20 government services,” explains Deena Bosch, Make All Voices Count Project Manager, Black Sash. “We monitored five primary health facilities; two local governments for participatory governance; and 13 South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) facilities. Waiting times seemed to be a common problem for all.”</p>
				<p>Black Sash collected the data by working with partner community organisations across the country. The community organisations were each given a tablet preloaded with survey software. Surveyors then went into the field with paper forms, which would be returned to the central coordinator and captured on the tablet, which reduced turnaround time significantly.</p>
				<p>Black Sash then worked with Code for South Africa through the School of Data programme in order to clean and analyse the data. </p>
				<p>“We used open source tools that are quite easy to use to do the data analysis and cleaning,” says Jason Norwood-Young, data journalist with Code for South Africa. “These free tools — such as Open Refine (for cleaning) and Google Spreadsheets (for analysis) are within the reach of all non-profits, and as data becomes more important in this sector, we see more and more civic organisations learning basic data literacy.”</p>
				<p>Once the data had been analysed, School of Data’s Cape Town fellow, Hannah Williams, visualised the data in posters. </p>
				<p>“It seemed an unusual choice for data, but we wanted to start conversations between the community organisations and government, and that’s difficult to do around a computer screen or pages and pages of work. Having people cluster around a poster and discuss it, however, is a very different and more inclusive experience,” says Williams.</p>
				<p>“The choice of high tech data analysis was to promote real dialogue and accountability between community members and public servants and service providers. This was a lesson from Black Sash’s first monitoring exercise,” says Bosch. “The posters helped greatly to present the findings of the monitoring exercise to the broader community and the government services monitored. At a glance it was possible to show what works and where more effort for improved services to poor communities should be concentrated. It is possible over time to show how combined efforts of organised communities and government can show favourable results.”</p>
				<p>Black Sash is currently supporting various community organisations to convene dialogues between community stakeholders and government departments that it monitored, and the results so far have been excellent. </p>
				<p>“Most of the 300 respondents per facility believed that government will respond favourably to the findings of these reports, and that government would use this information to improve service delivery,” says Bosch.</p>

					<h2 id="collection">Collection</h2>
					<p>Black Sash collected data from 12 SASSA pay points, five clinics, and two local government offices for its first monitoring and evaluation phase. Both frontline staff and citizens were interviewed for the clinics and pay points.</p>
					<p>By partnering with community groups, Black Sash got feet on the ground in five provinces. Results were captured electronically on iPads at the locations by volunteers, and fed through to Black Sash's head office in Cape Town.</p>
					<p>All in all, 20 community partners monitored 20 government services for this phase of Black Sash's M&amp;E programme.</p>

						<h2 id="cleaning">Cleaning</h2>

						<p>As is typical for a data-driven project, data cleaning took a large amount of effort. Black Sash and Code4SA used <a href="http://openrefine.org/">Open Refine</a> to clean the data - a tool initially developed by Google with the express intent of cleaning data.</p>

						<p>Open Refine can find spelling differences between words, and standardise on the correct spelling, such as "Johannesburg" versus "Johanesburg", "Joburg" or "JHB". </p>

						<p>The format of the questionnaire response was also not in a feasible format for analysis, so Open Refine was used to combine certain rows and simplify the data where necessary.</p>

						<p>Each questionnaire had to be meticulously cleaned, although certain recipes were created from one result set that could be applied to others. </p>

						<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>

						<p>We used <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets">Google Spreadsheets</a> to analyse the cleaned data. In particular, the pivot tables feature was used extensively to answer questions like: "Are the staff at this clinic well trained to provide quality service?", or "Does the physical condition of the building make a good working environment?".</p>

						<p>Pivot tables can also quickly give us demographics, like sex and age, and we could separate the data along these lines. Through this methodology, we could quickly see how gender or age would affect the experience of citizens at the various clinics, SASSA offices and government.</p>

						<h2 id="presentation">Presentation</h2>

						<p>One of the core purposes of Black Sash’s monitoring projects is to create dialogue between citizens and the service providers, and simply putting the results on the internet would not have fulfilled this purpose. By going a different route from the typical data project, Black Sash created data posters with the help of School of Data Fellow Hannah Williams.</p>

						<p>The posters created a physical focal point that communities and representatives from the organisations could literally gather around and discuss the results. </p>

						<p>The data design assumed no data literacy, the visuals had to speak for themselves and deliver their message without the need for lengthy explanations. </p>

						<p>While being simple, they had to adequately surface the problems that citizens were experiencing at public service points, and not "dumb down" the data or patronise any parties. </p>
